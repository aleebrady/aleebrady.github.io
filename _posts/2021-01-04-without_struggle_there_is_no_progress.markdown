The last five months have been a roller coaster ride. Balancing the assignments of this program and home life responsibilities have taken a lot of energy to get through it, but I am here. 

I had my final review on December 30th and it was a struggle to get through the last two months with the holidays being factored in. I am very grateful for this experience and I couldn't have done it without the support of my family helping with the kids. 

I very excited to get continue on my coding journey as I continue to learn more about OOP and working with JS within React. I not 100% sure of what I want to do next, but it's between continuing working with React or maybe re-visiting Ruby-on-Rails or learning something new like Python, since it's so desired. 

I really appreciate the Flatiron instructors I have. I appreciate the experience and knowledge I have gained, and I will take everything I have learned and continue to develop myself the best way I can.
