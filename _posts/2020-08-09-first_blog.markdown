Hello, 

I want to express this opportunity is very exciting and I'm very eager to learn as much as I can to became a proficient software engineer. 

I have been in technology for 10 years now and in that time I have learned some code (SQL, HTML, XML, Java), but I am not fluent in any one language, and I'm only able to partially read the code, I am not able write it, of fully understand what it does . That's why I am here. I want to solidify my knowledge gaps, not only to read and write it, but also create it. I grew up building all types of things, mostly electronics. Nowadays it's electronics and Ikea furniture. To build something virtual is a challenge to me and a challenge I want to conquer. 

By the end of the 16 week program, I hope to be in that position, where I have developed new skills to build something outside of the physical world. 

Thank you for reading. 

I will check back in soon with an update on how things are going.
